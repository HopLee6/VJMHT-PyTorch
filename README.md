## Introduction
We propose **V**ideo **J**oint **M**odelling based on **H**ierarchical **T**ransformer (**VJMHT**) for co-summarization, which takes into consideration the semantic dependencies across videos. 

VJMHT consists of two layers of Transformer: the first layer extracts semantic representation from individual shots of similar videos, while the second layer performs shot-level video joint modelling to aggregate cross-video semantic information. By this means, complete cross-video high-level patterns are explicitly modelled and learned for the summarization of individual videos.


Moreover, Transformer-based video representation reconstruction is introduced to maximize the high-level similarity between the summary and the original video.


## Requirements and Dependencies

- Python=3.8.5
- PyTorch=1.9, ortools=8.1.8487

## Data Preparation

Download the [datasets](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/datasets_zip/29974894) to ``datasets/``.

## Evaluation

Download [our models](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/VJMHT_trained_Models/29974912?file=57382336) to ``results/``.

Run the following command to test our models.

```
$ python main.py -c configs/dataset_setting.py --eval
```

where ``dataset_setting.py`` is the configuration file that can be found in ``configs/``. The results are saved in ``results/DATASET_SETTING/``.

Example for testing the model trained on TVSum in the canonical setting: 

```
$ python main.py -c configs/tvsum_can.py --eval
```

The results are saved in ``results/TVSUM_CAN``.

## Training
Run the following command to train the model: 

```
$ python main.py -c configs/dataset_setting.py
```

Example for training the model on TVSum in the canonical setting: 

```
$ python main.py -c configs/tvsum_can.py
```

The trained models and results are saved in ``results/TVSUM_CAN``.
